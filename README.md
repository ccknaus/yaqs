# Yaqs

This is Yet Another QR-Code Scanner... yaqs, ahm no, yay!

It does what a QR-code scanner is supposed to do: scan a QR code, interpret all the pixels, translate this into a human-readable format, and let the user do something with that scan result.

## Features for users
- Scan a QR code
- check if URL: open link and copy to Clipboard
- check if simple text: copy to Clipboard only
- history with persistent storage
- delete entries from history
